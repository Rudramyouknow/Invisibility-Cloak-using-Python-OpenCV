ðŸª„ Invisibility Cloak using OpenCV

This project creates a Harry Potter-style invisibility cloak using Python and OpenCV. A red cloth is detected in the webcam feed and replaced with the background, making it look invisible.

ðŸš€ How it Works Capture background without cloak. Convert each frame to HSV color space Detect cloak color (red) using HSV ranges. Replace cloak pixels with background. Display final output in real-time.
